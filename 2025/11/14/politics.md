Ananticipated meetingbetween Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaignChinalaunched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.

At that time, Beijingencircled the island democracywith unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.

It alsocut off contactwith the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty.

This time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead.

It also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to“serious” confrontationbetween the two powers.

Adefiant Tsaistaked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies.

But the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations andahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say.

“This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.

That doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil.

The opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response.

“Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said. But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.

The expected meeting, which McCarthy’s officeannouncedearlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations.

Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communicationamid flaring tensions over issues from a downedsuspected Chinese surveillance balloontosemiconductor supply chains– raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.

Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.

But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.

For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.

That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.

China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.

The party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.

That’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”

It is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.

Congress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.

While the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.

Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.

Though McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.

Last month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.

A meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.

Pelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated afever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoricin mainland China.

This time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.

But the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.

As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.

It could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT memberMa Ying-jeou, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.

Ma’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.

China is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighterglobal spotlightfollowing the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan.

Beijing has recently sought to position itself asan agent of peacein that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.

This week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.

An aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during aface-to-face meetingin Bali.

“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.

“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”

### 正文

TheChinese spy balloonthat transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.

The balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.

Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.

A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”

The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up,officials have said.

As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last yeardeveloped a method of trackingwhat it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.

The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.

CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC wasfirst to reporton the new intelligence.

The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It waseventually shot downby the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.

A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”

Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”

The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.

Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.

China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN hasreported.

Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.

This story has been updated with additional reporting.

CNN’s Alex Marquardt contributed to this report.

    <section class="content">
                <p>TheChinese spy balloonthat transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.</p>
        <p>The balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.</p>
        <p>Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.</p>
        <p>A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”</p>
        <p>The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up,officials have said.</p>
        <p>As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last yeardeveloped a method of trackingwhat it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.</p>
        <p>The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.</p>
        <p>CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC wasfirst to reporton the new intelligence.</p>
        <p>The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It waseventually shot downby the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.</p>
        <p>A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”</p>
        <p>Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”</p>
        <p>The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.</p>
        <p>Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.</p>
        <p>China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN hasreported.</p>
        <p>Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.</p>
        <p>This story has been updated with additional reporting.</p>
        <p>CNN’s Alex Marquardt contributed to this report.</p>

### 正文

党的十八大以来，习近平总书记的考察足迹遍及神州大地。祁连山麓、坝上林海，秦岭深处、黄河之滨，总书记在大江奔涌处谋划千秋大计，在山川锦绣间擘画生态蓝图。一系列重要论述，为新时代生态文明建设提供了根本遵循和行动指南。

世界环境日到来之际，我们跟随习近平总书记的脚步，一起呵护山水、寄情山水，领悟守护绿水青山、建设生态文明之道。

心系长江之变，习近平总书记前往沿江重镇，考察长江经济带发展。从三峡库区到洞庭湖畔，从港口码头到企业车间，总书记深入调研，作出一系列重要指示，为新时代江河保护治理提供了重要遵循。

2018年4月，习近平总书记来到湖南岳阳城陵矶水文站考察。在狭窄的站房外长廊上，习近平总书记举目远眺。“共抓大保护，不搞大开发”的战略定力，在这里化作守护一江碧水的坚定行动。

2023年10月10日下午，习近平总书记在江西九江市考察，冒雨在江边察看，了解当地长江国家文化公园建设、长江岸线生态修复等情况。10月12日，总书记在进一步推动长江经济带高质量发展座谈会上回顾长江经济带发展历程，感慨：“做就要做好，坚定做下去。笃行不怠，一以贯之，久久为功。”

黄河安澜是中华儿女的千年期盼。党的十八大以来，习近平总书记走遍黄河上中下游，望奔流激荡，思保护发展。在总书记的指挥下，一曲生态优先、绿色发展的“黄河大合唱”正在神州大地奏响。

2019年8月，习近平总书记考察甘肃时，亲临兰州考察黄河兰州段治理保护工作，对保护黄河、治理黄河作出重要指示，强调：“保护母亲河是事关中华民族伟大复兴和永续发展的千秋大计。”

2019年9月，习近平总书记在河南郑州黄河国家地质公园岸边驻足凝望。在随后举行的黄河流域生态保护和高质量发展座谈会上，习近平总书记再次强调“让黄河成为造福人民的幸福河”。

2024年9月，习近平总书记时隔五年后再次来到甘肃兰州，在中山桥段，驻足眺望。总书记由衷感慨：黄河很美，将来会更美。

从四次以长江经济带发展为主题的座谈会到三次围绕黄河流域生态保护和高质量发展为主题的座谈会，总书记“海晏河清”的期许，始终未变。

2019年8月，在甘肃山丹马场，习近平总书记步入草场，强调“保护好祁连山的生态环境，对保护国家生态安全、对推动甘肃和河西走廊可持续发展都具有十分重要的战略意义。”

2020年4月，习近平总书记在位于商洛市柞水县的秦岭牛背梁国家级自然保护区，考察秦岭生态保护情况。他语重心长地说，“保护好秦岭生态环境，对确保中华民族长盛不衰、实现‘两个一百年’奋斗目标、实现可持续发展具有十分重大而深远的意义。”

2021年3月，习近平总书记来到福建考察。在武夷山，总书记谆谆告诫：“武夷山有着无与伦比的生态人文资源，是中华民族的骄傲，最重要的还是保护好。”

2021年8月，在塞罕坝林场，习近平总书记登上月亮山，俯瞰荒原变林海的人间奇迹。习近平总书记指出，“我们建这片林，它的生态屏障作用，要永远发挥下去。”

从“绿水青山就是金山银山”到“山水林田湖草沙一体化保护和系统治理”，习近平生态文明思想如同春风化雨，推动着矿坑蝶变、沙地披绿。放眼中华大地，生态屏障持续筑牢，人与自然和谐发展。

2020年8月，习近平总书记来到马鞍山市，察看长江水情水势，了解岸线整治和渔民退捕工作落实情况。总书记特别强调，“长江禁渔也不是把渔民甩上岸就不管了，要把相关工作做细做实，多开发就业渠道和公益性岗位，让渔民们稳得住、能致富。”

2021年4月，在广西漓江的碧波上，习近平总书记回忆自己的深深的“漓江情结”，指出“广西旅游产业大有可为。”

2021年9月，在陕西高西沟村的一处山头上，习近平总书记举目凝望，指出“把生态治理和发展特色产业有机结合起来”。生态治理的宏大战略，最终要落脚于人民群众的获得感。

长江十年禁渔让“江豚逐浪”再现，黄河滩区迁建让百万群众安居，塞罕坝林场造就“绿色银行”，这些生动实践印证着：良好生态环境是最普惠的民生福祉。

从长江黄河的奔涌浪涛，到祁连武夷的峻秀风骨，习近平总书记的足迹丈量着中华大地的脉络，也勾勒出生态文明建设的壮阔图景。

新华社合肥6月5日电 中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理刘国中3日至5日到安徽调研“三夏”农业生产工作。他强调，要深入学习贯彻习近平总书记关于国家粮食安全的重要论述，按照党中央、国务院部署，扛稳政治责任，毫不放松抓好夏收夏种夏管，全力以赴夺取夏粮丰收，全面打牢秋粮生产基础，确保完成全年粮食生产目标任务。

刘国中先后来到宿州市、淮南市、六安市，深入小麦机收和夏播现场、农机跨区作业服务点、农事服务中心、粮食仓储中心、地方农科院等，实地察看夏收夏种、农机作业服务保障、粮食烘干收储等工作，详细了解农作物新品种选育、大面积单产提升、农资保供稳价、高标准农田建设等情况。

刘国中强调，“三夏”工作抓得好不好，事关全年粮食生产目标任务能否顺利实现。当前正值“三夏”农业生产关键时期，要抓住有利天气抢晴收获，组织好农机跨区作业，强化服务保障和安全管理，确保夏收高效进行。要抓实抓牢机收减损、烘干晾晒等各项措施，最大程度减少粮食损失。要精心做好夏粮收购工作，引导各类企业积极入市，保障粮食市场平稳运行。要压茬推进夏播，加强农资供应和农事服务，强化技术集成及推广应用，落实落细合理密植、精量播种等大面积单产提升措施，切实将试验田合成技术转化应用到大田中。要分区分类推进夏管，因地因苗加强田间管理，积极探索推广有效田管措施。

刘国中强调，要始终绷紧农业防灾减灾这根弦，充分估计可能出现的各类灾害风险，完善应对机制，做好应急预案，强化统筹调度，牢牢把握抗灾夺丰收主动权。要持续加强高标准农田建设，加快推进农田沟渠修复整治和平原涝区治理，补齐农田排涝设施短板。要完善部门常态化会商机制，加强气象精准预报和风险预警，科学调度水利工程，落实农业防灾减灾关键措施，为粮食稳产增产奠定坚实基础。

新华社北京6月5日电 中央军委主席习近平日前签署命令，发布《军事设施建设条例》，自2025年8月1日起施行。

条例深入贯彻习近平强军思想，深入贯彻新时代军事战略方针，聚焦服务备战打仗，适应新的领导指挥体制和保障模式，科学规范军事设施建设的基本原则、管理体制、运行机制和工作制度，是军事设施建设工作的重要依据。

条例共11章63条，按照军委管总、战区主战、军种主建的总原则，围绕理顺建设链、管理链、监督链，重点从军事设施建设计划管理、项目审批、工程发包、勘察设计、施工管理、应急建设、安全保密、监督问责等方面，厘清管理权限，优化流程机制，固化实践成果，为提高军事设施建设质量效益和保障能力提供有力法治保障。

新华社北京6月5日电　近日，中共中央办公厅印发《党组讨论和决定党员处分事项工作程序规定》，并发出通知，要求各地区各部门认真遵照执行。

《党组讨论和决定党员处分事项工作程序规定》全文如下。

（2018年11月29日中共中央批准　2018年11月29日中共中央办公厅发布　2025年5月26日中共中央修订　2025年5月26日中共中央办公厅发布）

第一条　为了规范党组讨论和决定党员处分事项，根据《中国共产党党组工作条例》、《中国共产党处分违纪党员批准权限和程序规定》，制定本规定。

第二条　坚持用改革精神和严的标准管党治党，落实党组（含党组性质党委，下同）全面从严治党主体责任，强化纪检监察机关派驻机构（以下简称派驻机构）监督职责，始终以严的基调、严的措施、严的氛围纵深推进正风肃纪反腐。

第三条　对党组管理的人员中的党员实施党纪处分，党组、纪委监委派出的纪检监察工委（以下简称派出机构）、派驻机构等应当按照规定权限和程序履行职责，加强协调沟通，有序顺畅衔接，形成工作合力，实现政治效果、纪法效果和社会效果有机统一。

第四条　党组讨论和决定本单位党员党纪处分事项。

对未经党组会议讨论决定任免，但属于党组管理的人员中的党员给予党纪处分的，也可以由所在单位党的基层纪律检查委员会（以下简称基层纪委）按照规定审查批准或者报党的基层委员会（以下简称基层党委）审议批准；给予开除党籍处分的，还须相应报党组会议审议批准。

第五条　派驻机构按照规定对党组管理的人员中的党员立案审查调查后，应当向被审查调查人所在单位党组主要负责人通报。党组应当支持派驻机构履行监督责任、查办违纪违法案件，并自觉接受监督。

第六条　派驻机构对驻在单位（含综合监督单位，下同）党组管理的领导班子成员、其他列入重点监督对象的党员涉嫌违纪违法问题立案审查调查结束，经内部审理、集体研究，提出党纪处分建议，并通报党组后，按照驻在单位党的工作领导关系移送相应的派出机构进行审理。

涉及敏感特殊案件，派驻机构报派出机关批准后，可以不移送派出机构审理。

对于重大、疑难、复杂案件，可以商请派出机构提前介入审理。

第七条　派出机构对案件应当认真审核把关、监督纠错，把握量纪平衡，形成审理报告并正式反馈。

派出机构应当定期分析党员干部违纪违法特点规律，向派出机关报告案件审理工作情况，重要情况及时报告。

第八条　经派出机构审理后，派驻机构将党纪处分建议通报驻在单位党组，由党组讨论决定。党纪处分建议与党组的意见不同又不能协商一致的，由派驻机构报派出机关研究决定。

对驻在单位党组管理的领导班子成员中的正职领导干部案件，派驻机构应当在派出机构反馈审理意见后，与派出机关有关部门沟通形成一致意见并通报驻在单位党组。

第九条　党组集体讨论决定党员处分事项，不允许任何个人或者少数人擅自决定和批准。

党纪处分决定以党组名义作出并自党组讨论决定之日起生效。

第十条　党纪处分决定作出后，应当正式通报派驻机构，并在1个月内宣布。

第十一条　党组讨论决定的党员处分事项，在党纪处分决定生效之日起90日内，基层纪委应当将党纪处分决定以及相关材料报相应派出机构备案。派出机构对备案材料应当认真审核，发现问题及时反馈并督促解决。

派出机构应当按年度向派出机关报送备案监督情况专项报告，必要时可以随时报告。

给予向党中央或者本级地方党委备案的党员干部党纪处分的，党组应当按照规定将党纪处分决定通报中央组织部或者本级党委组织部门。

第十二条　对于党的组织关系在地方、干部管理权限在主管部门党组的党员干部违纪案件，由派驻机构立案审查的，由主管部门党组讨论决定党员处分事项，并向地方党组织通报处理结果；由地方纪委立案审查的，由地方纪委按照程序作出党纪处分决定，并向主管部门党组通报处理结果。

前款所涉党员干部同时担任地方党委委员、候补委员或者地方纪委委员职务的，由地方纪委按照有关规定履行处分审批程序，并将党纪处分决定抄告主管部门党组。其中，地方纪委立案审查的，应当通过有监督执纪权限的相应派驻机构或者主管部门机关纪委征求主管部门党组意见后履行处分审批程序。

第十三条　党组应当结合讨论和决定党员处分事项等工作，查找体制机制问题、制度短板和监管漏洞，深入剖析问题根源，强化管党治党、净化政治生态、加强制度建设、规范权力运行，强化纪法教育、警示教育，深化以案为鉴、以案促改、以案促治。

第十四条　派出机构在派出机关领导下，建立健全对派驻机构以及基层党委、基层纪委审查处理案件的质量评查机制，并反馈评查结果，督促做好整改。

第十五条　党的工作机关、党委直属事业单位领导机构讨论和决定党员处分事项，参照本规定执行。

第十六条　中央纪委国家监委驻国务院国资委纪检监察组协助中央纪委国家监委加强对中央纪委国家监委驻中管企业纪检监察组工作的指导，会同中央纪委国家监委驻中管企业纪检监察组协作开展有关案件审理工作，参照本规定执行。

地方纪委监委未派出纪检监察工委的，可以直接组织审理有关案件，或者结合实际情况授权其他纪检监察机构审理有关案件。

新华社北京6月5日电 为推动节约能源法全面有效实施，促进更高水平、更高质量做好节能工作，全国人大常委会5日启动节约能源法执法检查。

节约能源法自1998年1月1日实施，并于2007年、2016年、2018年进行了修改。

记者5日从全国人大常委会节约能源法执法检查组第一次全体会议上了解到，为全面深入了解法律实施情况，此次执法检查采取实地检查与委托检查相结合的方式，检查组将赴天津、江苏、湖南、广东、广西、四川等省（区、市）开展实地检查，并委托北京、河北、山西、吉林、上海、重庆等省（市）人大常委会对本行政区域内节约能源法实施情况进行检查。检查组将采取实地检查、听取汇报、组织座谈、典型调研、专题研究、抽查暗访等多种方式，全面准确了解法律实施情况，对带有普遍性的问题深入调查研究。

检查组将重点检查8方面内容：落实节能管理制度情况，推进重点领域节能工作情况，重点用能单位节能管理情况，推动节能技术进步情况，实施节能激励措施情况，与法律配套的行政法规、部门规章以及地方性法规的制定情况，法律实施中存在的其他问题，对节约能源法修改的意见和建议。
